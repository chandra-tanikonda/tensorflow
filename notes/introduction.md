# Introduction

Tensorflow is a framework developed by Google to develop the machine learning and deep learning projects easily.

#### Important features of the tensor flow

- Tensor flow comes with high scalable features of computation with various data sets.
- TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs or GPUs and on various devices like desktops, servers, and mobile devices, making it highly versatile for different types of projects
- TensorFlow comes with TensorBoard, a suite of visualization tools that make it easy to understand, debug, and optimize TensorFlow programs. It provides visualization of ML models' metrics and parameters to help fine-tune their performance.
- TensorFlow provides extensive support for deep neural networks and machine learning techniques. It includes an array of tools and libraries that facilitate the building and training of neural models from scratch or using pre-existing models through transfer learning.
- Tensorflow optimize the use of memory; allowing for more memory management and reduced overhead when processing large data sets. This optimization helps when training large datasets.
- This framework ability to define,optimize and compute mathematical expressions using multi-dimensional array or tensors. This tensors are foundational and main blocks in tensorflow allowing it to handle data with high dimensionlity such as image, sound and text. This makes tensorflow powerful for many types of deep learning applications.
